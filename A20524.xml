            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE ſcope and drift of the firſt verſe is ſet forth vnto vs, that it is the duety of Parents to teach and inſtruct their children, and
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:10253:5"/> that it is the Childrens duty, firmely to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine in memory the inſtruction, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts of their Parents.</p>
            <p>The drift, and ſcope, of the ſecond verſe is to ſhew, that children ought to be perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of the loue of their Parents, to the end that they bee the better confirmed and ſtrengthened in the doctrine vvhich they teach them.</p>
            <p>IN this Chapter, two things are to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued: Firſt the Title: Secondly, An Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation, and admonition of <note n="*" place="margin">Called alſo <hi>Bathſhua.</hi> 1. <hi>Chron.</hi> 3.5</note> 
               <hi>Bathſheba</hi> the mother vnto <hi>Salomon</hi> her ſonne.</p>
            <p>The title is deſcribed by a double effici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent cauſe: Firſt by <hi>Bathſheba</hi> the author, which is noted by her relatiue; to wit, the mother of <hi>Salomon:</hi> And Secondly, by <hi>Salomon</hi> the reporter, who alſo is declared by another relatiue; to wit, the title of King. It is further alſo deſcribed by the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall cauſe, which is, that the mother ſhould inſtruct her ſonne <hi>Salomon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Afterwards is declared the duty of chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, which is faithfully to retain the whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome precepts, and admonitions of their parents, and rather then they ſhould be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten, to commit them to writing, to the end, that they may in their practice of life,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:10253:5"/> by their deedes expreſſe them, for the obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of children, dooth not ſo much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt in bowing the knees to their Parents, in giuing them outvvarde honour and reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, and in asking their bleſſing &amp;c. as in obſeruing the leſſons, and inſtructions, vvhich are deliuered to them by their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents.</p>
            <p>And as <hi>Salomon</hi> kept, and preſerued thoſe precepts, not for his owne vſe onely; but alſo for the profit of the poſteritie of the Church: So it behooueth children, after they haue applied them firſt to their owne vſe, to haue care to teach them to their children begotten by them.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Bathſheba</hi> the other efficient cauſe is to bee noted, the duety of Parents in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, and in ſpeciall of mothers; which is,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Eph.</hi> 6, 4</note> to bring vp and inſtruct their Children, euen their ſonnes in the feare of God,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Chron</hi> 28.9 <hi>Exo.</hi> 12, 26, 27</note> and to endewe them vvith leſſons and precepts, which may bee of vſe vnto them, not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly whileſt they are vnder their nurturing, gouernment, and ouerſight: but alſo may bee neceſſary and profitable vnto them for the framing and gouerning the vvhole courſe of their life:<note place="margin">2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 1, 5</note> and that euen from their <note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.15 <hi>Pro.</hi> 4.3</note> cradles; which appeareth by her lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing manner of ſpeech toward him, calling
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:10253:6"/> him <hi>Lemuel,</hi> a thing obſerued by mothers to their children, whileſt they are in their ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der yeeres.</p>
            <p>Then it is alſo to be noted in what things chiefly is ſeene the loue of parents, which is lawfull, to wit, that by how much the more they loue their children, by ſo much the more plentifully and abundantly they ſhould en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme them in the feare of God. For whereas <hi>Bethſheba</hi> held her ſonne <hi>Salomon</hi> moſt deere vnto her, as doth very manifeſtly appeare by the fourth chapter of the <hi>Prouerbs,</hi> verſe 31 and by the ſecond verſe of this chapter, ſhee did witneſſe and teſtifie this her loue, by a moſt diligent, and religious education of him, contrary to that which parents and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers (eſpecially in theſe dayes) doe; which doe expreſſe their loue to their children in cloathing them in gay apparell, feeding them with delicate meates, allowing them greater liberty, and licence of life, and by ouer much cockering of them. Which care as it is to bee vſed towards all children,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Chro.</hi> 28.9.10.20.</note> ſo more eſpecially towards thoſe of whom there is greater hope and expectation, that they ſhall one day liue in the publike ſight of men,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Gen.</hi> 49.1.2.</note> and as it were in the face of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealth, and of the Church. For, that it was knowne to <hi>Bathſheba,</hi> that <hi>Salomon</hi> her
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:10253:6"/> ſonne ſhould ſucceed in the Kingdome, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares 1. <hi>Kings</hi> 1.13.17. and that <hi>Dauid</hi> had three other ſonnes borne to him by <hi>Bathſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ba,</hi> it is manifeſt, 1. <hi>Chron.</hi> 3.5. And hitherto of the former part of this Chapter.</p>
            <p>There followeth the ſpeech or admoniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Bathſheba</hi> the Mother,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Verſe</hi> 2.</note> to her ſonne <hi>Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi> which conſiſteth in two things. Firſt in an inſinuating into fauour, or a foregarding of that which ſhee hath to ſpeake, verſe 2. Secondly, in the preceps ſhee giueth to him, verſe 3. And in the whole chapter following.</p>
            <p>In the former, <hi>Bathſheba</hi> doth it, that <hi>Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> might vnderſtand that he was only, and moſt deerely loued of her: and therefore that this her charge vnto him, poceeded from a moſt entire and feruent loue towards him.</p>
            <p>Hitherto belongeth her affectionate ſpeech; whereby ſhee giueth him to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, that her loue towards him was the greater, and that by the feruent, and louing affection of her minde, ſhee would teach him more things, then by her words he could at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine vnto.</p>
            <p>From whence it is to be vnderſtood, that in euery inſtruction or admonition, publike, or priuate, from equals, or vnequals, diligent heede is to bee taken, not onely that it doe proceede from loue, but alſo that it may bee
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:10253:7"/> made knowne vnto thoſe to whom ſuch ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition is giuen, that they are beloued of them, who in regard of their office and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, doe take vpon them to admoniſh and inſtruct them. As alſo by how much the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and harder things are giuen in charge, it is meete that there bee ſo much the more plentifull, and more abundant teſtimony de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared of their loue towards them that are admoniſhed: But aboue all things it is moſt commendable to leaue teſtimony of this loue,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ioſh.</hi> 7.19.</note> whereas more ſharpe medicines both of words and puniſhments are applied.</p>
            <p>Which thing to any man that will apply his minde vnto it, may eaſily appeare to haue beene obſerued of the Apoſtle, both in the Epiſtle to the <hi>Galathians:</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.14.19.</note> as alſo in the ſecond of the <hi>Corinthians:</hi>
               <note place="margin">2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.11. 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.15.</note> for as the Chyrurgions before they miniſter more ſharpe and biting remedies, doe vſe certaine lenitiues and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litiues: ſo in ſharpe correction, a more plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full teſtimony of loue (as it were a mollitiue) ought to be ſet before.</p>
            <p>Whereas ſhee calleth him the ſonne of her vowes, it appeareth that ſhee not onely delt with <hi>Salomon</hi> for his godly education, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo commended this matter to God, without whom all her paines taken to enforme, and inſtruct him would be but loſt and in vaine.</p>
            <pb n="7" facs="tcp:10253:7"/>
            <p>But whereas ſhee vſed not prayers onely but vowes, and that not one, but many, ſhee did therein declare both her ſingular loue towards <hi>Salomon,</hi> and her pietie towards God. Furthermore it ought to giue comfort and courage vnto parents, that there is ſuch plentifull fruit of the mothers inſtruction, prayers and vowes, as they by that meanes may through Gods bleſſing haue a ſonne ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celling both in piety, wiſdome, and glory.

               <p>THe ſcope &amp; drift of theſe verſes is, as alſo of thoſe that follow vnto the 28. to ſet forth vnto vs the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues of a good wife.</p>
               <p>And theſe vertues are, firſt of all, briefe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly comprehended in the 10. and 11. verſes:
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:10253:15"/> afterward they are more largely expreſſed. And in the 10. verſe ſhe is expounded to be deſcribed by a general property: then are reckoned vp the vertues, which are more proper to the mother of the family, which are diuided into two parts, her duty to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the perſon of her husband, and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the wole family, to the 25. verſe.</p>
               <p>Afterwards are rehearſed, the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues which are common both to godly men, and godly women, from the 25. to the 28. verſe. So as in this verſe, compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with ſuch skill, there are two things contained; firſt the excellent vertue of a woman to the 28. verſe: afterward, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of the ſame to the end of the booke. And her commendation is firſt ſet forth by her rareneſſe, which is concluded by the difficultie and hardneſſe to find her: which difficulty is declared by a queſtion; <hi>Who ſhall finde her?</hi> By which queſtion ſhe doth plainly declare, that ſuch a woman as here is deſcribed, the King ought diligently to ſeeke after, both by himſelfe, and his friends ſearching into euery corner of his kingdome. For if faithfull ſeruants are to bee ſought for from the vtmoſt parts of the kingdome:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pſal.</hi> 101, 2, 6</note> much more wiues, which are ioyned in a more ſtraight and inuiola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:10253:15"/> band: for which cauſe,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Gen.</hi> 24 3, 4</note> we ſee that <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> ſent his ſeruant vnto another coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, to take a wife for his ſonne <hi>Iſaac.</hi> And if <hi>Aſſuerus</hi> for the beauty of a woman,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Eſt.</hi> 2, 3</note> did cauſe all his kingdome to bee ſought and ſurueyed: How much more ought Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Princes to ſeeke her for her vertue. And if wee ſhall well examine the matter, this is one and a chiefe cauſe of this rare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; becauſe there are ſo few men which doe ſeeke after ſuch women. For if they were oftentimes, and of many men ſought for, no doubt but there would be greater plenty of ſuch women. But now, when women doe conſider in themſelues, that vertue and piety is not regarded, but beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, nobility and riches; and that if onely they haue them, they pleaſe their wooers: Therfore are they ſo carefull for them, and doe ſet their reſt vpon them. Whereof alſo it is, that the chiefe care of Parents is, to make them moſt beautiful, &amp; moſt rich; altogether neglecting piety and good huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiferie. Howbeit, in their words, there is ſo great vanity, in their countenance ſo deepe diſſembling, and in their manners, (for the time) ſo much counterfaiting and hypocriſie, that no man (although of the ſharpeſt wit) is able to iudge ſoundly, and
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:10253:16"/> perfectly of them. Wherefore they which doe take this in hand, truſting vnto their owne wit, are moſt groſſely deceiued, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe the helpe of God (firſt craued by praier) doe proſper and giue good ſucceſſe vnto their labors. Wherefore <hi>Salomon</hi> in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother place ſaith,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pro.</hi> 19.14 <hi>&amp;</hi> 18.22.</note> that <hi>Inheritance is left vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to children by their Parents, but a prudent wife is the gift of God:</hi> And in <hi>Eccleſiaſtes</hi> making mention of the great miſchiefe of a wicked woman, he ſaith, that he which is good in the ſight of the Lord,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 7.26.</note> is deliuered from her, but that the ſinner is ſnared by her. Shee is further deſcribed by another ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iunct of her price, which is often wont to ariſe from the former rareneſſe, for thoſe things which are rare are good, and that which is rare is deere. But her price or worth is ſet forth by a compariſon of the leſſer, to wit, of carbuncles, not one, but many: vvhich alſo is amplified by a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of the greater, for he doth not only ſay, that her value is a aboue carbuncles, but that it is far aboue them. So as it ſhould ſeeme an vniuſt thing to bring them in compariſon together, and as it were ſo weigh them together in balance.</p>
               <p>That wife therefore may bee ſufficiently endowed, which is well nurture; and that
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:10253:16"/> not onely becauſe vertue of it ſelfe is a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine treaſure, but becauſe God doth moſt commonly follow ſuch a woman, with the bleſſing of riches. But the iudgment of men is farre otherwiſe: for except a woman be endowed either vvith a great ſtocke, or large rents, ſhee is no more eſteemed for her piety, then a flint, or any other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible ſtone vvhich lieth abroad in the ſtreets and high-vvaies. But vvhat things are here ſpoken of a woman of ſtrength, the ſame may alſo by a little turning of the word, bee fitly carried and applied vnto ſuch a man.</p>
               <p>After that he hath generally deſcribed this excellent woman, he deuideth her du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty into two parts, whereof the former is concerning her duety towards her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, the other towards the whole family. Both which being briefly comprehended in this verſe, are afterwards more largely vnfolded. And that which concerneth the former, doth ſeeme rather to belong to the praiſe of the husband, then of the wife. For it is the commendation of the huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band to truſt his wife, not to be ouer iea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous towards her, neither to ſuſpect her faithfulneſſe towards him: which many men doe, who vndeſeruedly doe ſuſpect
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:10253:17"/> their wiues. But hee which ſhall more throughly enter into this matter, ſhall finde it rather to bee referred to the praiſe of the wife: For he teacheth, that ſo great and ſo abſolutely perfect is her faithfulne<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, both in words and behauiour, alone, and in company, that her husband may ſurely reſt vpon her: For it is otherwiſe with this woman,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pro.</hi> 7.10.18, 19.20.</note> then with that which is ſpoken of otherwhere. Whereof alſo that doth appeare, that it is not ſufficient that wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men doe keepe themſelues chaſte, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touched of vicious men, vnleſſe alſo they be of that integrity and vprightneſſe, that they miniſter not ſo much as the leaſt oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of ſuſpition. For you may ſee many women, which although ſometimes they be farre from the crime of adultery, not onely in act, but alſo in conſent; notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding by reaſon of their geſture and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauiour, they are not free from all markes and notes of immodeſtie. Wherein the ſincerity of elder times may condemne the looſeneſſe of this age:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Gen.</hi> 26, 8, 9.10</note> whereas by the ſpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting onely of <hi>Iſaac</hi> with <hi>Rebecca,</hi> their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage (contrary to that which they preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted) was coniectured: which is ſo much the more worthy the noting, in as much as it was not lawfull for the brother to
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:10253:17"/> ſport with his owne ſiſter. For whereas <hi>Rebecca</hi> by the aduiſe of her husband,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Gen.</hi> 26.7.</note> had carried her ſelfe as <hi>Iſaacs</hi> ſiſter, and <hi>Iſaac</hi> had carried himſelfe as <hi>Rebeccaes</hi> brother, the counterfeiting of them both, was by this ſporting diſcouered. Amongſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane heathen in times paſt, ſuch great ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty of manners was obſerued, that it was accounted an vnhoneſt thing,<note place="margin">Alex. Gen. lib. <hi>4.</hi> c. <hi>20.</hi> p. <hi>243.</hi>
                  </note> for Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents with their children, and Fathers in law with their ſonnes in law, to be bathed together in one bath.</p>
               <p>But how much good and quietneſſe there is in this faithfulneſſe and chaſtity of the wife, whereby the husband is free from all ſuſpicion of diſhoneſty, may bee eaſily diſcerned by the contrary torment of ſuch men, as are vexed with the ſpirit of iealouſie. And this by a little turning of the words, may be drawne to the due<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the man towards his wife. The other duety is prouiding for her familie, and it is declared by the effect of a woman of ſtrength, to wit, procuring of plenty; eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially of houſhould furniture, which is ſet forth by likning her to thoſe, which hauing obtained the victory, and ſlaine their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies: doe bring the ſpoiles home to their houſes. By which metaphor hee ſheweth
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:10253:18"/> that ſhee doth by her labour and induſtry helpe very much, for the maintaining of their eſtate. But hereof more ſhall be ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in the reſt of the Chapter.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>erſe</hi> 12.</note>He afterwards returneth to the deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of her duety towards her husband, which firſt is propounded by the effect, that is, that ſhee will doe good vnto her husband; which is amplified by denying of the contrary. By which manner of ſpeech he declareth that ſhee will doe nothing, but that which ſhall be good and commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious vnto him, for ſhee is giuen him of God for a helper.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Gen.</hi> 2, 18.</note> He teacheth therefore that it is the part of a good wife, to pleaſe her husband in all things, ſo farre as it may agree with the duty of a good and godly woman: for if for his good ſhee doth ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times that which may diſpleaſe him, ſhee doth not againſt her duty. Hitherto there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhee ought to bend her endeauor, that ſhee may be praiſed without all exception. But there are to bee found many women, of whom it is ſaid, ſhee is a faithfull and chaſt woman, but yet a froward peece, ſhee is a good wife, but curſt, and ſomewhat too talkatiue, and haſty to anſwere. But of this woman it is generally ſaid, that ſhee is loiall, gentle, &amp; perfect in euery iuſt &amp; good duty.</p>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:10253:18"/>
               <p>Afterwards this duty is amplified by the adiunct of the length of time; that is to ſay, all the daies <hi>of his life.</hi> It is growen to a common Prouerbe amongſt vs, to call the firſt moneth after mariage, the hony moon: Wherby, men wil ſhew that the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings of mariage are pleaſant, but that there follow after many bitter yeeres. By another ſimilitude alſo, they do compare the ioy of a widow deſiring mariage, to a fire of thornes, which after a ſhort blaze is preſently put out and quenched. But this duty of a godly woman is not comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in leſſe then the whole life of time. For ſhe will not onely do good to her husband whileſt he is young, but when he is old al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, not only in health, but alſo in ſickneſſe, not only in proſperitie but alſo in aduerſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. And theſe duties are alſo to be perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of the husband toward his wife, and ſo much the more grieuouſly doth hee of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend, if hee ſwarne from his dutie, in as much as God hath made him more ſtrong, and furniſhed him with greater gifts.</p>

                     <hi>Gen.</hi> 20, 1</note> It appeareth by holy Scriptures, that <hi>Sara</hi> and <hi>Rebecca,</hi> euen in their olde age kept the traces and features of their beautie they had in their youth: and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore no doubt but they had a care to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue their beauty, that they might be moſt gracious and pleaſing to their husbands: but that through this care of their beauty, they did ceaſe from all honeſt labour and buſineſſe; it neither can agree with their duty, nor with thoſe excellent vertues wherewith they were endued. But if to Princeſſes and honorable women, it be not allowed to be idle, and to ceaſe from honeſt buſineſſe (whereas they notwithſtanding, in regard of the weakeneſſe of their ſexe, both are and ought to bee fauoured aboue others) can it bee lawfull for men to take vnto them this licence to liue at their plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, without any imployment. Wherein the men of our age doe more grieuouſly offend then the women. For what man is there that hath rents and poſſeſſions aboue the common ſort, which by this bounti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:10253:20"/> of God towards him, doth not thinke himſelfe freed and diſcharged from all honeſt imployment: ſo as hee thinketh he is in good ſtate, if abſtaining from doing wrong to others, he doe in the meane time giue himſelfe to all looſenes of minde, ſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding his time both in hunting, hauking, and other pleaſures of this life. Furthermore whereas ſhee doth her ſelfe ſeeke wooll and flaxe, not ſtaying till they ſhould be proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by her husband: hereby is ſet forth her readineſſe to labor, which is proued by the words following; for whereas he ſaith, that ſhee doth theſe things according to the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingneſſe of her hands, hee doth thereby teach, that ſhee doth readily and cheere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully goe about her worke, wherein aboue all things her ſtrength is declared. For ſuch things as are laid vpon vs by reaſon of our calling, ought to be done merrily and with a cherefull minde, for like as the ſunne like a giant doth gird it ſelfe, that it may in 24. houres runne his whole circuit about the world; ſo likewiſe ought wee to ſtirre and raiſe vp our ſelues to that worke, which is laid vpon vs. Men therefore (which haue a minde of more courage, and are of greater ſtrength of body) may bee aſhamed to lye downe vnder the burden of ſuch labors, as
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:10253:21"/> are enioyned them. And this cherefulneſſe is therefore propounded, that he may ſhew that thereby the worke is the more eaſily and ſpeedily diſpatched.</p>

But the holy Ghoſt teacheth vs, that it is the wiues duety to prouide thoſe things wherewith the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milie is fed; and not ſuch things onely as are neere at hand, but which alſo are brought from farre countries: from whence hee ſheweth, that ſhee fetcheth them in mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants ſhips; becauſe ſhee bringeth her foode from farre. Wherein ſeemeth ſome doubt, how a woman being by nature and calling, limited to keepe home, ſhould fetch her foode from farre. Whereto I anſwere, that ſhee fetcheth her foode from farre, not by trauelling into forraigne Countries, or paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the ſeas, but by ſending the workes of her hands into ſtrange Countries, from whence ſhee may receaue either Corne or other marchandize in exchange; and thoſe things which at home are not to be had, ſhee may fetch from other places commodiou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlie. But thoſe things, when they are ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of the Queene, what woman is there,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:10253:21"/> which ought in regard either of her owne, or her husbands honour, to bee freed from the duty of procuring thoſe things which may be of vſe, not onely for her ſelfe, but for the nouriſhing alſo of her whole family. So as not the leaſt part of the pompe and mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificence of the King, may ſeeme to depend on the prouidence and labour of his wife and Princeſſe: by which meanes alſo commeth great freedome vnto the ſubiects, from tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes, taxes, ſubſidies, and other exactions.

               <p>Shee is further deſcribed, by an adiunct of her watchfulneſſe, and taking little ſleep:
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:10253:22"/> For, her mind being buſied about her houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold affaires, doth not ſuffer her to ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſleepe her ſelfe; but like a watch, dooth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wake her betimes.</p>
               <p>Many women there are, which although they giue themſelues much ſleep, being not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding once wakened and raiſed, they do with great readines &amp; diligence diſpatch buſineſſe of the houſe, and in that reſpect they are praiſe-worthy. But this woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> here deſcribed by the holy Ghoſt, doth not only merrily and cheerefully buckle her ſelfe to diſpatch her matters, but doth alſo betimes, and early ſet her hand to her worke. Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then people and ſtrangers from God could ſee, that the Gouernour of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth and the Councellor, ought not to ſleepe the whole night: But the holy Ghoſt requireth this euen in the mother of a fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that ſhee ſhould riſe before the night be ſpent. True it is indeed, that it is ſaid in the 104. <hi>Pſalme,</hi> that man goeth forth to his la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor at the ſun-riſing: but this is no let at all, but that thoſe things which are to be done in the houſe, as well of men, as women, may be begun before day. For they cannot by the helpe of a lanthorne doe thoſe things which are to bee done abroad, and in the field: whereas notwithſtanding the things
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:10253:22"/> at home may bee diſpatched by the candle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light. But if it doe not well beſeeme a woman of ſtrength to ſleepe till day light; how ill may it beſeeme a luſty man, which hath the ſtrength of his limbes. And what things are in the ſixt Chapter,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pro.</hi> 6.6</note> and in ſundry other places layde to the ſloathfull mans charge, the ſame no doubt, in like manner, may fitly be obiected to ſloathfull and idle women.</p>
               <p>This vigilancie or watchfulneſſe he deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth by a double end, whereof the firſt is, that ſhee giueth to her whole family their foode, and that according to the ſexe and degree of thoſe which are of the family: for, it hath been before ſayd in the 27. Chap. &amp; 26.27. verſes, that there is one kinde of diet for the men ſeruants, another for the maids, one diet alſo for ſlaues, another for free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, one for thoſe that are ſtrong, another for ſuch as are weake, one for the whole, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother for the ſicke. The other end is that ſhe ſetteth her maides and waiting ſeruants their taske: where is to be noted, that ſhee is carefull for foode for the whole family, but not that ſhe doth therefore appoint the men ſeruanes their worke (which belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth to her husband) but onely to her mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens.</p>
               <pb n="38" facs="tcp:10253:23"/>
               <p>Then it is further to be noted, that ſhe giueth foode, and that ſhe appointeth the workes, and preſcribeth both the portion and the taske. For there are women to be found which doe appoint worke enough, and more then enough, but doe allow but a ſmall portion. Others there are which doe allow plentie of foode, but haue ſmall care of the performance of their worke: neither of theſe is to approued, neither of them is free from danger; for the one be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wraieth a baſeneſſe and vileneſſe of the minde, the other bringeth pride and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogancie.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Verſe.</hi> 16.</note> Her diligence and watchfulneſſe is further declared by the effect, to wit, that ſhe conſidereth a field, which ſhe purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth and planteth with vines. For ſo farre is ſhe from diminiſhing the Kings rents, as ſhe doth rather enlarge them.<note place="margin">

And this is a verie orderly thing, that to the end ſhe may builde a houſe, ſhe doe firſt ſet her minde to buy a fielde. For the rule is good of them, which ſay there is leſſe profit in a houſe without a fielde, then a fielde without a houſe.

               </p>
               <p>Moreouer, here is to be obſerued, that ſhe doth not firſt prouide her ſelfe of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant and delightful things, but thoſe things wherwith theſe are maintained.</p>

               <p>HEre firſt of all, is propounded to be conſidered, her continuall and vnceſſant labor to procure riches
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:10253:24"/> vnto the 20 verſe: then doth he adde, for what vſe ſhe getteth wealth vnto the 24. v. In the former part are contained two ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of a woman of ſtrength, and a cauſe of the effects. The effects are comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in the 17.19. and latter part of the 18. verſe. And the cauſe of theſe effects is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared in the former part of the 18 verſe. Firſt of all therefore a man may here aske how this manner of ſpeech which is here attributed to a woman, that ſhe grideth her ſelfe with ſtrength, and ſtrengtheneth her armes, may ſtand with the glory of God, foraſmuch as that which is proper to God alone is caried to a woman. For euen Kings themſelues are altogether without ſtrength,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pſa.</hi> 18, 33, 34 35 <hi>Iam.</hi> 1.</note> ſauing that God doth gird them with might, whereof being depriued, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently the become weake and feeble. Sure it is that the ſtrength of the body, (euen as euery good gift) commeth from God aboue, in whom we liue, doe moue, and haue our being: yet ſo notwithſtanding, as God doth not exclude our endeauour, no not ſo much as in the worke of ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Acts</hi> 17.28 1. <hi>Tim,</hi> 8, 16 <hi>Ia.</hi> 4, 5, 8, 9, 10.</note> much leſſe in the worke of this life, for the performance whereof, there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth not ſo great ſtrength after the blot of ſinne. And firſt of all ſhe may well
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:10253:24"/> be ſaid to gird her loines and her armes with ſtrength, for that ſhee excerciſeth her ſelfe and her body with labor: for as by idlenes &amp; ſlothfulnes the ſtrength is enfeebled in ſome ſort, as yron vnuſed is eaten with ruſt, ſo by moderate exerciſe the ſtrength is increaſed &amp; augmented. Hereof is it that husbandmen &amp; laborors hauing their health, the ſlothfull &amp; ſluggiſh are oppreſſed with ſundry diſeaſes.</p>
               <p>Furthermore in another reſpect ſhee may well bee ſaid to ſtrengthen her loines, and her armes, for that ſhee conceiueth great hope to perfect theſe things which ſhee ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth in hand. For there are many which of a faint-hartedneſſe and baſe diſpaire of their minde, dare not enterpriſe any excellent thing; or hauing begunne it, out of an opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of difficulty to finiſh that which they haue imagined to themſelues, doe caſt it out of their hands vnexpected. So comes it to paſſe, that through a vile and baſe feare, and diſtruſt, they doe as it were lay bands vpon themſelues, and being fettered hand and foote, they become vnfit and vnable for any notable worke, wherein there appeareth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſhew of difficulty. Hereof the Iſraelites ſetting before themſelues the height of the wals of the land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> &amp; the taulnes of the men, reiecting alll hope of vanquiſhing
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:10253:25"/> that Country beganne to thinke of retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning into <hi>Egypt.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>This cowardneſſe and baſeneſſe of minde in thoſe, that belong vnto the Kingdome of Heauen is greater, for although there are ſome, which haue found the way and life ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry eaſie; yet many alſo are ſo diſcouraged with the difficulty thereof, that they will not once enter into this courſe. Which thing is manifeſtly declared in the words of <hi>Moſes, Deut.</hi> 30.11.12.13.14.15. Alſo 1. <hi>Iohn</hi> 5.3. and <hi>Math.</hi> 11.30.</p>
               <p>Heere the cauſe (as often els where) is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted as well of this which hath gone be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, as of other effects which doe follow: to wit, that ſhee findeth the fruit of her labour to be good, and to haue good ſpeede in thoſe things which ſhee hath labored. And this hee amplifieth by a compariſon of the like: For as hee which taſteth good and delicate meates neuer proued before: with the ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe thereof, is entiſed and egged on to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure the ſame againe, although it bee with ſome hard and ſharpe labor; ſo this woman being taught by the experience of the fruit of her labour and induſtry, doth the more cheerefully follow the ſame.</p>
               <p>Thoſe therefore which are ſloathfull and idle, for as much as they reape no fruit of
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:10253:25"/> their idleneſſe, are not ſtirred vp with any deſire to labour. Such alſo as with labour wearying both themſelues and theirs, doe notwithſtanding receiue none at all, or very ſmall fruite of their paines (becauſe God not being called vpon by them refuſeth to giue his bleſſing) theſe men alſo muſt needes faint vnder the burden of their labours.<note place="margin">

                  </note> As on the contrary this woman (whoſe labours God by his bleſsing doth proſper) making won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull gaine, is encouraged to vndergoe her paines. And no doubt but the Iſraelites when they had once taſted of the fruites of the land of Canaan, did the more couragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly ioine battell with the inhabitants thereof. Euen as alſo we ſee that good ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting hounds, with the onely ſent of the beaſt, which they doe courſe, doe mend their pace, and with greater ſwiftneſſe doe chaſe their pray. On the contrary it comes to paſſe in many, who when as through the bleſsing of God vpon their honeſt labours, they are grone to ſome wealth, do giue them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to idleneſſe, and to their pleaſures, till they haue waſted that which they had got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten with paine.</p>
               <p>This in matters belonging to the life to come, is more euidently perceiued; for that ſo many hearers of the Goſpell, doe ſo cold<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:10253:26"/> frequent the aſſemblies of the Church, in the preaching of the Goſpell, adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Sacraments, and other ordinary ſeruice of God: it proceeds from no other cauſe, but this, that they haue not taſted the fruit of the forgiueneſſe of their ſinnes, euen the peace of conſcience. Whereas, if ſo be they had but taſted onely how good the Lord is, it cannot be vttered with what fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uentneſſe and zeale they would runne vnto the meetings of the Church, and would thirſt after them,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pſal.</hi> 42.1. <hi>Iam.</hi> 2.1.2 3.</note> as the Hart chaſed by the dogges thirſteth after the waters.</p>
               <p>There followeth another effect of the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient cauſe before declared: which is, that her light is not put out by night. It was ſaid before that ſhe preuenteth the day: Now he addeth that ſhe ſo abideth to her worke, that ſhe maketh not an end of her worke with the day, but draweth it forth and continueth it a great part of the night: Neither doth ſhe (as ſome doe) labour by fits, but perſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth and perſeuereth conſtantly in her workes.</p>
               <p>Hereof may be gathered that ſhe breaketh her ſweete ſleepe, For riſing ſo early and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to bed ſo late; eſpecially when ſhe hath beene painefull in her worke; the ſounder
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:10253:26"/> ſleepe muſt needes fal vpon her, ſo as ſhe (but with ſome violence) doth not awake. Which thing is to be obſerued of all, both men and women. For as it is not lawfull to eate vnto a fulnes: ſo likewiſe it is not lawful to ſleepe ſo long, till we haue ſatisfied our luſt. It hath bin ſaid before, how this woman of ſtrength appointed maides their taske: he now ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth further, that ſhe doth her ſelfe ſet her hands to worke. Hitherto alſo pertaineth ſhe buſieth her ſelfe in the ſame kinde of worke; with her maides, handling the whele and the diſtaffe, one after another. Although it be not vnlikely that ſhe did ſpinne finer and coſtlier woole and flaxe, yet it is certaine that it was labourſome, and painefull, both the wheele &amp; the ſpindle, whereto ſhe was to put her ſtrength, and vſe her might.</p>
               <p>For to what end is it, that it was ſayd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that ſhee girdeth her ſelfe with ſtrength but that ſhe ſhould haue need of ſtrength to do her worke: Wherto alſo pertaineth that, which is ſpoken in this verſe that ſhe putteth both her hands to the ſpindle. For, it is a thing layde vpon all the poſteritie of <hi>Adam,</hi> not only to labour, but to labour hardly and with paine: For, notwithſtanding that God hath appointed vnto women, ſuch workes as haue leſſe weariſomnes in them, in regard
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:10253:27"/> of the weakeneſſe of their ſexe, and of their paines of childe-bearing: yet are they not freed from thoſe duties, which are ioined with ſome paine and tediouſneſſe.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, it is to be noted that by this her working, ſhe is not only her ſelfe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed, but ſhee doth alſo take away all co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor of idleneſſe from her maides: for it were a ſhame for the maides to plucke their hands from ſuch work as their miſtris her ſelf doth not diſdaine to doe. For here is that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerbe true, which is ſanctified by the holy mouth of Chriſt; that it is well with the ſeruant if he be in the ſame condition with his maſter, it is well with the hand-maide, if ſhee be in no worſe caſe then her miſtris. But this example of paines taking, which ſhe giueth to her maides, is of more force to worke in their mindes, then many admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitions or chaſtiſeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts which are vſed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out example.</p>
               <p>This point alſo is to be obſerued, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme and ſtrengthen vs in the common du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of this life, as things acceptable vnto God; conſidering that the Anabaptiſts do eſteeme of thoſe things as too vile for Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians to exerciſe themſelues in: But the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts although they condemne not theſe things, yet they make the hands of godly

               <p>There followeth, both the varietie and number of the workes, wherein ſhe is occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pied: and alſo, the end whereunto they are referred, which doth crowne all her former workes; and without the which it skilleth not much, whether the mothers of families be ſloathful or diligent in their worke. For, if ſhe ſhould only lay vp in a cheſt theſe her riches gotten with paine, ſhould heape vp treaſures, or beſtow them in trifles and toies, there were no cauſe why this praiſe ſhould be giuen her. But now when as both in get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them her induſtry is declared, and in diſpoſing them her piety and wiſdome ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth; no ſufficient co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mendation can ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily be giuen vnto her.

The which, although it ſeeme ſcarce to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree with the turning of the wheele, and handling of the ſpindle and diſtaffe: yet the holy Ghoſt hath thought them very agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. And here no doubt he bringeth in this woman ſo delicately apparelled, that hee might thereby commend theſe womanly workes and exerciſes vnto all poſterity, as thoſe which are worthy, and fit for ſuch as are cloathed in very delicate apparel, ſo as their eſtate and degree will afford it. Which is not to bee vnderſtood of all women, but according as euery ones eſtate will ſtretch; for this womans husband was among the chiefe, as appeareth in the 23. verſe. But here ſome man may aske, whether it be fit that hee ſhould firſt prouide for her owne ſelfe.</p>
               <pb n="53" facs="tcp:10253:30"/>
               <p>To whom I anſwere, that it is meete that ſhee prepare neceſſary couering for thoſe of her houſhould, before ſhee ſet her minde vpon delicacy, and fineneſſe of apparel for her ſelfe: euen as alſo ſhee ought to ſeeke for neceſſary foode for her family, before ſhee take thought for dainty meates for her ſelfe.</p>
               <p>Whereupon it followeth,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 2 9. 1. <hi>Peter</hi> 3 3.</note> that thoſe teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies againſt coſtly attire, which the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſpeakes of, are not ſimply to be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, but by compariſon of godlineſſe, more carefully to be ſought for then the finenes of apparell.

               <p>Another effect or end of her continuall labour, conſiſteth in making ornaments,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Verſe.</hi> 23.</note> whereby as by certaine markes and ſignes her husband may be knowne, and diſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned from other men, which is amplified by an adiunct of the time, when he goeth and fitteth in the aſſembly of the Eelder, where
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:10253:31"/> ſpecially it beſeemeth him to be moſt come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly apparelled.</p>
               <p>But here ſome man may moue a doubt, how it may ſtand with the duty of a louing wife, that firſt ſhee prouideth ornaments for her ſelfe, and afterwards for her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band. Whereto I anſwere, that the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ornaments of the body, are more fit for women then men, and that there com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth credit and praiſe to the man by the comely apparell of his wife, euen as it would be to his diſcredit, if hee himſelfe being gaily apparelled, his wife ſhould be without or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments. Sheee doth therefore trimme her ſelfe not ſo much for her owne, as for her husbands both credit and delight.</p>
               <p>From all which things it appeareth that there is nothing ſo great or ſo ſmall in the houſhould, that there is none from the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt to the loweſt, from the head of the fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly euen vnto the foote, whom her care doth not reach vnto. For euen as in the common wealth thoſe that are ſo carefull for one part, as they neglect another, they doe grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouſly offend: and contrariwiſe they doe ſafely gouerne the ſame, which doe extend their care ouer all. So likewiſe in a family, ſhee which is ſo carefull for her husband and children, that ſhee neglecteth her ſeruants
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:10253:31"/> and maides, doth very dangerouſly offend.</p>
               <p>Some man will thinke that ſhe is marue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly diligent in vndergoing her labours,<note place="margin">

               <p>But all her other things in generall are coſtly: and ſuch whereof otherwiſe by reaſon of the long and doubtfull cariage, the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t ſhould neuer make perfect.

<pb n="57" facs="tcp:10253:32"/> but in this place he bringeth in mention of further a kinde of raiment.</p>
               <p>This manner of cloathing is of the minde, as the former was of the body.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Tim.</hi> 2, 9 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.34</note> This is the ſame which the Apoſtles doth principally commend vnto women, and doth preferre before all other ornaments, though neuer ſo precious and without the which, euen ſhe which is moſt neately and daintely cloathed is but naked and bare before God, the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, and holy men.</p>
               <p>But of this inward cloathing there are two parts ſet downe, ſtrength, and honour and comelines: whereof in the one is noted the confidence of her minde, whereby being without feare ſhe enioyeth reſt and quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe: by the other thoſe vertues, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide that they come from a minde well af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected doe procure a ſingular bewty, worthy of all men to be looked vpon.</p>
               <p>And truely what things haue beene ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken hitherto, as they doe belong to the due<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of a good Matron, ſo may they ſometimes be found in women, which are voide of all true piety, in <hi>Iewes,</hi> in <hi>Papiſts,</hi> in <hi>Turkes.</hi> But thoſe things which doe follow, are of that kinde which as they doe onely fal vnto god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Matrons, ſo doe they adde great glory vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the former gifts, and doe as it were crown
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:10253:33"/> them. And firſt for the ſtrength of the minde it is proued by the effect, that ſhee feareth not the inconuenie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces of the time following, which in men either quite deſtitute, or light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly endued with this truſt in God, doth breed continuall vnquietneſſe.

In the goods of this life wee doe couet after thoſe things, which are leſſe ſubiect to change, as vnmoueable, rather then moueable.

               <p>And thus much of the inward ſtrength, there followeth the honour or comelineſſe; that is, thoſe vertues which haue a comely ſight in the iudgement of the Angels, and all godly men: where in the firſt place com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth, that ſhee doth not vſe ſpeach, but wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and warily, which is very fitly applied vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this woman.

Whereunto it is a great helpe, that a woman be conſtant and continuing in her labour; for euen as the Apoſtle doth define idlenes,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.</note> &amp; ſloathful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to be the ſeede of much talke in youn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger widdowes, ſo continuance in labour, is a ſingular remedy againſt raſhneſſe, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardneſſe of the tongue.</p>

<pb n="61" facs="tcp:10253:34"/> not ſo much in the common ſpeach of the things belonging vnto this life, which may be in infidels, as in another ſubiect of ſpeach, it is a conference of holy matters. For he ſaith that the doctrine of benignity and kindneſſe is in her tongue. By which manner of ſpeach hee ſeemeth to declare both couenaunts of workes and of grace; whereof in the one the bounty of God to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards vs doth ſtand; and in the other our loue both towards God, and towards our neighbour for Gods cauſe is required. For ſhee is not onely a hearer and reader of the word of God, but alſo ſhee conferreth ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of with her children, with her maides, and with her husband, inſtructing her children and maidens, as we reade of <hi>Heſter,</hi> (for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept her maides had firſt beene inſtructed to celebrate the Faſt, they had beene altogether vnfit) and asking of her husband thoſe things whereof ſhee ſtandeth in doubt.<note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.</note> Whether is to bee referred, that in the booke of the Kings the name of mother is added, as a furtherer either of piety, or impietie of the children. Whereby the Ieſuites are confuted, which doe ſo ſtraightly tie the women to the wheele and ſpindle, as they doe cut them off, and
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:10253:35"/> barre them from all conference touching the word of God, as abſurde and far vnbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeming their ſexe. See the examples of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na:</hi> 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 2. And of the wife of <hi>Manoah,</hi> 14. of <hi>Iudges.</hi> And of <hi>Mary, Luke</hi> 1. And of <hi>Priſcilla,</hi> which both inſtructed and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded <hi>Apollo</hi> in the way of the Lord. Whereby appeareth how carefull godly women haue been for true knowledge out of the word of God: Whereas hee ſayth that doctrine &amp;c. reſteth in her tongue, hee doth thereby plainly declare, how often ſhe vſed ſpeech, and how plentifully it dwelt in her houſe.</p>

               <p>Another effect of this matrone is; that ſhee ſearcheth and prieth into the whole carriage of her houſhold, for it is not enough to appoint them what they ſhall doe, vnleſſe ſhee doe as it were call them to account &amp; reckoning, and finde out whether they haue well performed their taske: which is
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:10253:35"/> to be vnderſtood not ſo much of matters belonging to the houſe (which are euen per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed of infidels) ſometimes as of holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe which conſiſteth either in pietie, and godlineſſe towards God, and righteouſneſſe towards men. For notwithſtanding that the chaſtiſing and puniſhing of the men ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants, ſlaues, and of the ſonnes that are of age, is to be reſerued to the husband, yet it is her part to inquire into the waies of the whole family; which is alſo required of the father of the family.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, the metaphor of (prying) ſeemeth to declare, that ſhe doth ſometimes ſearch into the manners and faults of her ſeruants and houſhold, euen when they are not aware and thinke nothing of it: euen as a ſpie or a ſcout, lieth in wait to looke forth whether the enemy approacheth vnto the City and tents.</p>
               <p>The concluſion of all which is, that ſhe eateth not the bread of idleneſſe. For when ſhee getteth wooll and flax, when as riſing in the morning before day, and ſitting vp a great part of the night, ſhe appointeth her family their portion, and her maides their taske, when as ſhe ſetteth her owne hands to the wheele and ſpindle, when as ſhee proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth for her houſhold cloathing, for her
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:10253:36"/> houſe furniture, for her ſelfe, coſtly apparel; and for her husband ornaments, when ſhee inſtructeth her family: And finally, inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth into the waies of her whole houſhold, it eaſily appeareth that ſhee eateth not the bread of idleneſſe.</p>
               <p>But thoſe are ſaid to eate the bread of idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, which do receiue their meate, when as no honeſt labor hath gone before, and which is not gotten by labour: Wherby is confirmed that which is commaunded of the Apoſtle,<note place="margin">2. <hi>Theſ.</hi> 3.10</note> that thoſe that will not labour ſhould not eate. But if it be therefore con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, that ſhe eateth not the bread of idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, becauſe ſhee is ſo buſied as wee haue ſayd: it is euident that thoſe are vtterly to be condemned of ſloathfulneſſe, not onely which labour not at all, but euen thoſe alſo which in doing their worke are more ſlacke and negligent.</p>

               <p>THe ſcope and drift hereof is, hauing propounded a reward to ſtirre vp women to higher vertues; it is a true ſpeech that <hi>Honour nouriſheth arts;</hi> and that all men are kindled with a deſire of praiſe, and that thoſe things are deſpiſed and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>temned which are miſliked of euery one. Which may be applied vnto the deſire of vertue and godlineſſe: for although to iuſt and vncorrupted Iudges, the fruite of their duty is the dutie it ſelfe, and it belongeth vnto the godly to ſeeke after vertue, for ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues ſake, and a conſcience towards God; yet God pittying our infirmity and ſlowneſſe to good workes, doth ſet before vs a reward, as it were a crowne to bee enioyed both in this life, and in the life to come; to the end he may correct our ſluggiſhneſſe, and drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:10253:37"/> in well doing. Which being a thing neceſſary for men to whet them on to the deſire of vertue, it is manifeſt that it is more expedient for women, as thoſe which are weaker. Whereof it is that the holy Ghoſt doth make this garland of praiſe which he may ſet vpon the head of ſuch a induſtrious woman, as he hath deſcribed that as by her vertue and pietie, ſo alſo by the reward of condigne praiſe, ſhe may be diſcerned from other women.</p>

                     <hi>Verſe</hi> 28.</note>The chiefe good of all is, that ſhe think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and feeling her ſelfe happy, ſtandeth not in feare of any danger which may befall her. But it is to be accounted in ſome degree of happines, if in regard of her good works ſhe be worthely co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded of good men: eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, when as by this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mendation of her ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t facts is ſealed vp the aprobatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of her good works by God himſelfe. But that her own children, are here brought in by the H. ghoſt for ſpreaders of her praiſes, it may ſeem ſomewhat ſtrange. For, whereas (according to the teſtemony of the Prophet, (as wee haue heard before) <hi>A mans ovvne praiſe in his ovvne mouth hath no grace;</hi> It muſt needs be that the commendation of thoſe of her owne family; eſpecially, ſuch as are more neerely ioined vnto her, is but of ſmall force
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:10253:37"/> to ſet her forth, as that which may ſeeme to proceed, either of ſelfe-loue, or flattery, that they may gaine ſomewhat of her. I anſwer, that beſides the proper ſence, here is a figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratiue ſpeech, wherein by children is vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, the dyet and apparell of her chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, the honeſtie of the childrens manners; but chiefely their pietie and feare of God, wherewith by her carefull education; ſhee hath endued them, which are as it were ſo many mouthes and tongues, whereby the praiſes of a woman of ſtrength are publiſhed.</p>
               <p>Not vnlike vnto this is that which is ſaide in the 127. <hi>Pſalme.</hi> Where he is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced bleſſed which hath a quiuer furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed with children, who ſhall not bee aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med when he contendeth with his enemies in the gates. Hereof alſo proceeded that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation of the woman <hi>Luke</hi> 11.27. al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though ſhee were therein deceiued, if ſhee thought that Chriſt tooke any part of his wiſedome, or goodnes of his mother, when as he was taught of himſelfe.</p>
               <p>He mentioneth this prayſe of the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren towards their mother, becauſe her children, through her godly and wiſe edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation doe liue in that light and honour, which redoundeth vnto the commendation of their mother; whereas he ſaith that they
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:10253:38"/> ſhall riſe, that they may praiſe her, he ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to ſet forth their ripe age, when as (by marriage or publique charge) they come a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, whereas thoſe which were of vnripe yeares, ſeemed to lie at home in ſilence. For being come to yeeres, they are then either an honour, or diſhonour to their Parents: as in the 127 <hi>Pſalme,</hi> children are then like ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes wherwith their parents enimies are ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſlaine or wou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded when they are of age.</p>
               <p>Hence doe Parents learne, which doe neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect the godly and honeſt bringing vp of their children that they nouriſh in their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, which may afterwards bite them, when they grow to ripeneſſe of age; who whereas if they haue vſed diligence and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuour in well bringing vp their children, they haue wherewith to comfort them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, againſt their exceſſe and wickedneſſe whatſoeuer. As on the contrary, in the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe and honeſty of the children, they haue a ioyfull reſt and comfort, wherewith to ſtrengthen themſelues and the manifold griefes and inconueniences of old age, being as it were their winter.</p>
               <p>To omit that there haue beene ſome, who going to the gallowes for their lewdneſſe, haue curſed their mothers, becauſe of their fooliſh cockering, they haue beene left vnto
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:10253:38"/> themſelues, and their owne luſts: as on the contrary, children being well nurtured, will bleſſe their mother, becauſe ſhee hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed them, chaſtened them, and kept them within the bounds of their duty.</p>
               <p>Which teſtimony of children, like as alſo that of the husband, which followeth, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it be leſſened in regard, that in blood they are very neerely knit vnto her; yet is it of the greater credite: becauſe they are eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witneſſes of her actions, and whole conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation. But children ought ſo much the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to ſtirre vp themſelues vnto a deſire of vertue and piety, as that by their praiſe or diſpraiſe, credit, or diſcredit, their Parents are either honoured, or diſhonored, as thoſe which haue part with their children, as well in the one as in the other.</p>
               <p>The honor therefore which by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement is due to Parents by their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, is not ſhut vp within their fathers houſe, but continueth throughout the whole courſe of their life, euen then truely, when being departed forth of their Parents houſe, they are ſpread abroad in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealth, neither is the obedience due to their parents, then only violated, when they doe trangreſſe their commandements, but alſo when they doe defile themſelues with
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:10253:39"/> any lewdneſſe, and wickedneſſe in any kinde whatſoeuer; whereof alſo it is that <hi>Salomon</hi> ſaid before, that the <hi>fooliſh ſonne bringeth ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row to his father.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Her husband ſhall praiſe her: This com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation alſo of her Husband ſeemeth to be of ſmall force to ſet forth her praiſe, by reaſon of that neere coniunction, which is betweene them, which will diminiſh the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority and force of the praiſe, beſides the danger of being ſollicited to breake her fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity by his praiſing of her to others. The commendation therefore which her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band giueth her, is firſt of all in priuate and at home, which bringeth no inconuenience, and whereby the vertue and induſtry of the wife is increaſed.</p>
               <p>Furthermore (as before in the children) ſo here there is a figuratiue ſpeech; for the vigorous and good bearing of his age, his good diſpoſition of body, and the orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of his apparell (whereof we haue ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken before) but eſpecially for that ſhee whet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth him on to piety, euen then, when he holdeth his peace, doth aboundanly ſpeak of the praiſe of his wife.</p>
               <p>For as the holineſſe of the wife commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth the piety of her husband,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.</note> becauſe ſhee is as it were the image of the man: ſo the
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:10253:39"/> excellent piety and godlineſſe of the man doth ſet forth a religious woman: which godlineſſe, it is no doubt, but his vertuous wife hath in ſome meaſure wrought in him. Thus did <hi>Priſcilla</hi> helpe <hi>Aquila</hi> in godlines, in which regard ſhee is by the holy Ghoſt ſet before her husband, although a faithfull man: as in the 14. of <hi>Iudges, Sampſons</hi> mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is ſet before her husband <hi>Manoath.</hi> Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the commendation of the children, and of the husband, there followeth alſo the praiſe of the holy Ghoſt, ſpeaking by the pen of <hi>Salomon:</hi> who doth by a compariſon of the leſſer amplifie her praiſe. But ſhee is compared not with a careleſſe, and ſloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full woman, but with a woman of ſtrength, and not with one alone, but with many to whom ſhee is not equalled, but farre pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred, and placed as it were in a higher e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate; but if it be asked, what women of ſtrength theſe are, to whom this woman is preferred. I anſwere, they are thoſe, which being void of faith towards God, doe not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding imbrace chaſtity, loue their husbands deerely, prouide plentifully for the diet and clothing of their family, ſeeke woll and flax, ſet their hands to the wheele and ſpindle, riſe before day, goe to bed late, are carefull for furniture for their houſe, of
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:10253:40"/> all ſorts, doe decke both themſelues and their husbands, doe thinke of a field which they buy, and plant it with vines: but in the meane time being void of faith, are feareful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly terrified with the euils to come: yea, euen with ſhaddowes of euils, as before hath been declared out of the 25. 26 and 27. verſes. And truly in this kinde there are found not onely Popiſh women, Iewes, and Turkes, but alſo ſome profeſſors of the Goſpell, but in ſhew onely: before all which (though in number infinite) one of theſe is farre to be preferred, not onely in theſe vertues, which are proper and perculiar to her; but in thoſe alſo which doe fall into both kindes of wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men. For although the ſame things be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed of them both, notwithſtanding ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the one doth them of conſcience to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God, the other of a certaine inſtinct of nature, or to get praiſe and commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion amongſt men, it appeareth that there is as much difference betweene them, as is betweene heauen and earth. Hereby ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth, how precious a thing faith is, wherewith all our workes are, as it were, perfumed, to be acceptable vnto God, and without which, the moſt glorious workes ſtinck, and in their greateſt glittering are not withſtanding ſinnes.</p>
               <pb n="73" facs="tcp:10253:40"/>
               <p>In this verſe hee doth by another argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, from a compariſon, ſet forth her praiſe, where he preferreth her before a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, that is exceeding faire and well fauo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: where alſo there ſeemeth to be a mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting with a ſecret and priuie obiection; the obiection is drawne from an apparant charge of the Prophet, as if hee were not wiſe and skilfull enough in deſcribing and ſetting forth this woman, neuer ſufficiently praiſed: as he, which in the reckoning vp of her vertues, had forgotten two ornaments, her beauty and comelineſſe, vnto which the Prophet anſwereth, by an adiunct of the deceit of fauour, and vanity of beauty. But vanity and deceit are not of one ſort. For firſt of all they are deceitfull and vaine; becauſe the beauty and good fauour is vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed and painted, whereby the fowleſt wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men haue appearance, and goe for faire, which vpon the feeling of the fire, or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther heate melt away. Furthermore becauſe that beauty and fauour, which pleaſeth to day, diſpleaſeth to morrow, and that which is now eſteemed to be a trace of beauty in the eies of the louers, is by and by accomp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a wart or a wenne. As appeareth by the example of <hi>Amon,</hi> who being inflamed with the loue of his ſiſter <hi>Thamar,</hi> becauſe
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:10253:41"/> of her beauty: was as it were in a turning of a hand, in a deadly hatred of her.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, it is very truly called deſceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and vaine, becauſe as it were a flower, it periſheth, with the leaſt blaſt of the winde of the iudgement of God, indeed fauour and beauty is the gift of God, wherefore it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore compared by <hi>Salomo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  </hi> vnto a ring of gold yet hath the holy ghoſt thought it vnworthy to be reckoned among the former vertues.</p>
               <p>But by this former Iudgement of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt, God would note the folly of men, who in chooſing their wiues, doe principal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inquire after that, whether ſhee bee faire and well fauoured, ſo as if ſhee haue thoſe, although ſhee bee endued with none of the former vertues, yet ſhee is accounted fit for them. And contrariwiſe ſhee which is indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the former vertues, vnleſſe ſhee haue alſo fauour and beauty, is ſcorned and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſed of all men: wherein the madneſſe of men doe notably bewray it ſelfe, that they doe carry themſelues ſoe careleſly and diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely in a matter of great weight, and wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in conſiſteth the quietneſſe of this whole life, and no ſmall helpe to the life to come. If a man buy a horſe, is he ſo mad that hee will reſt onely in the colour and ſhape of his body neuer looking whether he be lame or broken winded. Or if a man buy a golde
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:10253:41"/> ringe, doth he thinke himſelfe ſatiſfied that in ſhew onely it gliſtereth like gold? or doth he not rather bring it to the touchſtone, to try whether it be pure gold or gilt onely.</p>
               <p>The eſtimation of fauour &amp; beauty, is yet diminiſhed by the vnfit praiſe, which is not meet for a woman indued with them; which is amplified by a compariſon of the diſlike: becauſe a woman fearing God is worthy of praiſe: for notwithſtanding that fauour and bewty (in regard that they are the gifts of God) doe deſerue commendation, yet ſhee which hath them, ſeemeth not to deſerue praiſe, ſeeing they are gotten by no skill or labor of hers, no, not ſo much as by her will: for except it were giuen her of God euen from the cradle, ſhee ſhould labor in vaine to get it: but the feare of God, notwithſtanding it be the gift of God, yet is it not giuen at the firſt, but to ſuch, as doe will and deſire it (God inclining their wil &amp; affection) &amp; being once begunne it receiueth increaſe through our deſire care and induſtry.</p>
               <p>So as notwithſtanding, a faire and beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull woman for her beauty may be praiſed; yet in compariſon of that notable and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular commendation which is rightfully done vnto the woman that feareth God, ſhe is not to bee thought praiſe-worthy. And
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:10253:42"/> then by a compariſon of the greater is leſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the praiſe of beauty, and comelineſſe is beaten downe: and this deniall and leſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the praiſe of good fauour and beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, is more ſtrongly declared, by this word, (ſhe doth get praiſe vnto her ſelfe) as if the beautifull and well fauoured woman did not ſo.</p>
               <p>Hereby is refuted not onely the vanity of men, but alſo their ingratitude towards God, which do imploy the whole power of their wit and learning, for the praiſe of beauty and fauour, not onely generally in the whole body, but particularly in euery part of it, from the head to the heele, vſing thereunto all the flowers and colours of their eloquence, wherewith they garniſh and ſet them forth, who in the meane time in the commendation of vertue, are either dumbe, or cold.</p>
               <p>He goeth <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="31"/> forward in the reward and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence of this woman of ſtrength, where the holy Ghoſt by the Prophet doth cal vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all men, that they ſhould yeeld vnto her the prayſe due vnto her vertues and notable workes. The holy Ghoſt therefore doth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort her husband, that both while he liueth, &amp; when he is going to death, he ſhould deale liberally with her in diet, cloathing and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:10253:42"/> lawfull and honeſt delights of this life, and ſhould graunt them vnto her bountifully &amp; plentifully for her vſe. Hee exhorteth her children and ſeruants, that they do vſe all ſingular reuerence and obedience towards her: neither doth he exhort onely thoſe of her familie, but alſo all others; yea euen the Magiſtrates themſelues, ſo often as occaſion is offered (as when women are brought in iudgement before them, for ſome ſlip in their manners, it is not vnſeaſonable to ſet before their eyes the laudable conuerſation of this vertuous woman) that they doe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy themſelues to ſet forth her praiſe: For notwithſtanding that this woman, together with her notable workes be ſhut vp and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited within the wals of her owne houſe, yet her praiſe paſſing forth, and climbing vp the top of the houſe commeth &amp; appeareth at the holy ſeate of Iuſtice.</p>
               <p>Whom therefore God commendeth and thinketh worthy to be praiſed, in the extol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of them, we ought to imploy, not onely our tongues, and pennes; but euen alſo as it were our ſhoulder, wherewith being borne vp, and vnderpropped, they may bee, as it were, lifted vp into an open place, from whence their vertue may be ſeene of all.</p>
               <p>The which ought to confirme vs in the
